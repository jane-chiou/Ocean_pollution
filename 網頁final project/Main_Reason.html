        <h2>
            1.  Industrial Emissions
        </h2> 
        <h3>
            Industrial emissions constitute a significant source of marine pollution, involving the discharge of wastewater, gases, and solid waste generated during industrial processes. These emissions may contain toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and other pollutants that, upon entering the ocean, can severely harm water quality and marine ecosystems. For example, organic nitrogen, phosphorus, and chemicals may lead to water quality deterioration, causing harmful algal blooms and impacting marine life.
        </h3>

        <h2>
            2.  Plastic Waste
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Plastic waste has emerged as a rapidly growing issue in marine pollution in recent years. Large quantities of plastic products entering the ocean persist for extended periods, forming vast areas of floating plastic debris known as plastic islands. This not only affects the ecology of marine organisms but also has the potential to disrupt the food chain, ultimately impacting human food safety. Additionally, plastic debris can be ingested by marine organisms, leading to injuries and fatalities.
